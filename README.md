# Data Science Salary predicting tool

In this **Data Science** project, I created a tool for predicting salary for data science jobs from *glassdoor.com*.

## Project Overview:
* Collected job data from glassdoor.com by **webscraping**.
* **Cleaned** about 1000 data using Python.
* Done **EDA** on cleaned data with help of Python libraries like matplotlib, pandas etc.
* Optimized differnet **ML models** like Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
* Built a client facing API with the help of **flask**
  
  
  
The project was done by following a YT playlist by **Ken Jee** (link below)
